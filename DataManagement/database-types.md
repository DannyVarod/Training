Before you choose where and how to store your data,
consider the different available options, what each is good and bad at,
how to optimize the data you store in each, for both speed and ease of access,
how you can use each for different use-cases and decide which to use and for what.

Often using more than one for the same solution, each for different purposes can yield the best result.
